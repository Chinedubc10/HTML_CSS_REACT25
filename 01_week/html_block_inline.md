Block and Inline Elements in HTML
HTML elements are categorized as block-level or inline-level, each playing a specific role in defining the structure and layout of a webpage. Understanding these categories is essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing content.

Block Elements
Characteristics
Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container.
They are primarily used to define the structural layout of a webpage.
Examples include headings, paragraphs, and division containers.
Common Block Elements

<div>: A generic container for grouping content.

<div>This is a block element.</div>
<p>: Defines a paragraph of text.

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<h1> to <h6>: Represent headings with varying levels of importance.

<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<ul> and <ol>: Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>: Used for long quotations.

<blockquote>Here is a blockquote.</blockquote>
Inline Elements
Characteristics
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
They are primarily used to style or modify small parts of content within a block element.
Common Inline Elements
<span>: A generic inline container for styling or grouping text.

<span style="color: red;">This text is red.</span>
<a>: Defines hyperlinks.

<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
<strong> and <b>: Make text bold.

<strong>Important text</strong>

Combining Block and Inline Elements
Block and inline elements can work together to create well-structured and styled content. For example:

<div>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>
    This is a paragraph with an <a href="#">inline link</a> and some <strong>bold text</strong>.
  </p>
</div>
